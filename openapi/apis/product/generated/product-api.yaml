      summary: Retrieve a single product
      description: |
        Retrieve the complete product information for a specific manufacturer product combination.

        This endpoint returns a single product identified by the composite key of
        `manufacturerIdGln` and `manufacturerProductNumber`. The product key is at the root level,
        with nested objects for each component:

        - **details**: GTINs, brand, dates, customs data, status, warranties
        - **descriptions**: Multilingual product descriptions (nested array)
        - **etimClassifications**: ETIM classifications with embedded features (nested array)

        **Subresources**: Each component is also available as a dedicated subresource:
        - `/details` - Core product information
        - `/descriptions` - Multilingual descriptions with language filtering
        - `/etim-classifications` - ETIM classifications with features

        **ETIM Classification Filtering**: Use the optional `etimReleaseVersion` query parameter
        to filter ETIM classifications to a specific release version (e.g., "9.0", "10.0").

        **No pagination** - Returns exactly one product document or 404 if not found.

        **Composite Key**: The combination of manufacturer GLN and product number uniquely
        identifies a product in the system.

        descriptions to specific language(s). If not specified, all available languages are returned.

        **Nested structure**: Unlike the bulk endpoint `/bulk/product-descriptions` which uses
        a flattened structure optimized for ETL, this single-product endpoint returns descriptions
        in their natural nested format for easier consumption.

        **No pagination** - Returns all descriptions for the specified product.

      description: |
        Retrieve all ETIM classification information for a specific manufacturer product combination.

        This endpoint returns all ETIM classifications (class codes, features, version information)
        for a single product identified by the composite key of `manufacturerIdGln` and
        `manufacturerProductNumber`.

        **ETIM Classification Filtering**: Use the optional `etimReleaseVersion` query parameter
        to filter classifications to a specific release version (e.g., "9.0", "10.0"). If omitted, the latest etimReleaseVersion is returned.

        **No pagination** - Returns all ETIM classifications for the specified product.
        A product can have multiple ETIM classifications across different releases.

        **Use case**: Ideal for retrieving detailed ETIM classification data for a single
        product without fetching all product details.

        Retrieve Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) environmental data for a specific 
        manufacturer product combination.

        This endpoint returns Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) information including:
        - Declared unit (unit and quantity)
        - Reference service lifetime
        - Third-party verification status
        - EPD operator and registration details
        - Product Category Rules (PCR) references
        - Life cycle declarations for different stages (A1-A3, B1-B7, C1-C4, D)

        The product key is at the root level, with LCA environmental data nested inside.

      summary: Retrieve product ETIM classifications in bulk
      description: |
        Retrieve product ETIM classification feature data in a flattened format with cursor-based pagination.

        **Flattened Structure**: Each row represents a single feature value within a product's ETIM classification.
        This structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes (each row has consistent structure)
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination by feature
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        **Data Reconstruction**: To reconstruct the hierarchical structure:
        1. Group rows by `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` for products
        2. Within each product, group by `etimClassCode` + `etimReleaseVersion` for classifications
        3. Features are individual rows within each classification group

        **Classification-Only Rows**: Products with classifications but no features are represented
        with `etimFeatureCode` omitted to ensure all classifications are included in the response.

        **ETIM Release Filtering**: Use the optional `etimReleaseVersion` query parameter
        to filter classifications to a specific ETIM release version (e.g., "9.0", "10.0"). If omitted, latest etimReleaseVersion is returned.

        **Use case**: Ideal for bulk synchronization of ETIM classification data to external systems,
        data warehouses, or analytics platforms.

        Retrieve product LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) declaration data in a flattened format 
        with cursor-based pagination.

        **Flattened Structure**: Each row represents a single life cycle stage declaration within 
        a product's LCA environmental data. This structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes (each row has consistent structure)
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination by declaration
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing
        - Filtering by life cycle stage

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        **Parent Context**: Each row includes key parent fields from LcaEnvironmental
        (`declaredUnitUnit`, `declaredUnitQuantity`, `lcaReferenceLifetime`, `thirdPartyVerification`)
        to provide necessary context for interpreting the environmental indicators.

        **Data Reconstruction**: To reconstruct the hierarchical structure:
        1. Group rows by `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` for products
        2. All rows for a product share the same parent context (declared unit, lifetime, verification)
        3. Each row represents a different life cycle stage (A1-A3, B1-B7, C1-C4, D)

        **Life Cycle Stage Filtering**: Use the optional `lifeCycleStage` query parameter
        to filter declarations to a specific EN 15804 life cycle stage.

        **Use case**: Ideal for bulk synchronization of environmental product declaration data 
        to external systems, sustainability reporting, or analytics platforms.

        Flattened product description for bulk retrieval.
        Each row represents a single language description with the product identifier.

        This flattened structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes per row
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing
        - Language filtering at row level

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values may be omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        Flattened product LCA declaration for bulk retrieval.
        Each row represents a single life cycle declaration within a product's LCA environmental data.

        This flattened structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes per row
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        **Parent context fields**: Key fields from the parent LcaEnvironmental object are included
        (`declaredUnitUnit`, `declaredUnitQuantity`, `lcaReferenceLifetime`, `thirdPartyVerification`)
        to provide necessary context for interpreting the environmental indicators.

        Bulk response containing flattened product ETIM classification features with cursor-based pagination.

        **Flattened Structure**: Each row represents a single feature value within a product's ETIM classification.
        This structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes (each row has consistent structure)
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination by feature
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        **Data Reconstruction**: To reconstruct the hierarchical structure:
        1. Group rows by `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` for products
        2. Within each product, group by `etimClassCode` + `etimClassVersion` for classifications
        3. Features are individual rows within each classification group

        **Classification-Only Rows**: Products with classifications but no features are represented
        with `etimFeatureCode` omitted to ensure all classifications are included.

        2. All rows for a product share the same parent context (declared unit, lifetime, verification)

      summary: Retrieve a single product
      description: |
        Retrieve the complete product information for a specific manufacturer product combination.

        This endpoint returns a single product identified by the composite key of
        `manufacturerIdGln` and `manufacturerProductNumber`. The product key is at the root level,
        with nested objects for each component:

        - **identification**: Manufacturer details, GTINs, brand, dates, customs data
        - **details**: Status, type, warranties, product groups
        - **descriptions**: Multilingual product descriptions (nested array)
        - **etimClassifications**: ETIM classifications with embedded features (nested array)

        **Subresources**: Each component is also available as a dedicated subresource:
        - `/identification` - Product identification only
        - `/details` - Product details only
        - `/descriptions` - Multilingual descriptions with language filtering
        - `/etim-classifications` - ETIM classifications with features

        **ETIM Classification Filtering**: Use the optional `etimReleaseVersion` query parameter
        to filter ETIM classifications to a specific release version (e.g., "9.0", "10.0").

        **No pagination** - Returns exactly one product document or 404 if not found.

        **Composite Key**: The combination of manufacturer GLN and product number uniquely
        identifies a product in the system.

        This endpoint returns product descriptions including minimal, unique main, full descriptions,
        marketing text, specification text, application instructions, keywords, and product page URLs
        for each available language.

        **Language filtering**: Use the optional `language` query parameter to filter
        descriptions to specific language(s). If not specified, all available languages are returned.

        **Nested structure**: Unlike the bulk endpoint `/bulk/product-descriptions` which uses
        a flattened structure optimized for ETL, this single-product endpoint returns descriptions
        in their natural nested format for easier consumption.

        **No pagination** - Returns all descriptions for the specified product.

      summary: Retrieve all ETIM classifications for a product
      description: |
        Retrieve all ETIM classification information for a specific manufacturer product combination.

        This endpoint returns all ETIM classifications (class codes, features, version information)
        for a single product identified by the composite key of `manufacturerIdGln` and
        `manufacturerProductNumber`.

        **ETIM Classification Filtering**: Use the optional `etimReleaseVersion` query parameter
        to filter classifications to a specific release version (e.g., "9.0", "10.0"). If omitted, the latest etimReleaseVersion is returned.

        **No pagination** - Returns all ETIM classifications for the specified product.
        A product can have multiple ETIM classifications across different releases.

        **Use case**: Ideal for retrieving detailed ETIM classification data for a single
        product without fetching all product details.

      summary: Retrieve product ETIM classifications in bulk
      description: |
        Retrieve product ETIM classification feature data in a flattened format with cursor-based pagination.

        **Flattened Structure**: Each row represents a single feature value within a product's ETIM classification.
        This structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes (each row has consistent structure)
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination by feature
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        **Data Reconstruction**: To reconstruct the hierarchical structure:
        1. Group rows by `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` for products
        2. Within each product, group by `etimClassCode` + `etimReleaseVersion` for classifications
        3. Features are individual rows within each classification group

        **Classification-Only Rows**: Products with classifications but no features are represented
        with `etimFeatureCode` omitted to ensure all classifications are included in the response.

        **ETIM Release Filtering**: Use the optional `etimReleaseVersion` query parameter
        to filter classifications to a specific ETIM release version (e.g., "9.0", "10.0"). If omitted, latest etimReleaseVersion is returned.

        **Use case**: Ideal for bulk synchronization of ETIM classification data to external systems,
        data warehouses, or analytics platforms.

        Flattened product ETIM classification feature for bulk retrieval.
        Each row represents a single feature value within a product's ETIM classification.

        This flattened structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes per row
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        **Classification-only rows**: Products with classification but no features are represented
        with `etimFeatureCode` omitted (or null if explicitly set).

        each containing descriptions in a specific language.

        Unlike the bulk endpoint `/bulk/product-descriptions` which uses a flattened structure
        optimized for ETL, this single-product endpoint returns descriptions in their natural
        nested format for easier consumption.

        **Language Filtering**: Use the optional `language` query parameter to filter
        descriptions to specific language(s).

    BulkProductEtimClassificationFeaturesResponse:
      type: object
      description: |
        Bulk response containing flattened product ETIM classification features with cursor-based pagination.

        **Flattened Structure**: Each row represents a single feature value within a product's ETIM classification.
        This structure is optimized for:
        - Predictable payload sizes (each row has consistent structure)
        - Efficient cursor-based pagination by feature
        - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
        - Streaming data processing

        **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
        to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.

        **Data Reconstruction**: To reconstruct the hierarchical structure:
        1. Group rows by `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` for products
        2. Within each product, group by `etimClassCode` + `etimClassVersion` for classifications
        3. Features are individual rows within each classification group

        **Classification-Only Rows**: Products with classifications but no features are represented
        with `etimFeatureCode` omitted to ensure all classifications are included.

            2. `manufacturerProductNumber` (ascending)

  Bulk response containing flattened product LCA declarations with cursor-based pagination.
  
  **Flattened Structure**: Each row represents a single life cycle declaration within a product's 
  LCA environmental data. This structure is optimized for:
  - Predictable payload sizes (each row has consistent structure)
  - Efficient cursor-based pagination by declaration
  - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
  - Streaming data processing
  - Filtering by life cycle stage
  
  **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
  to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.
  
  **Parent Context**: Each row includes key parent fields from LcaEnvironmental
  (`declaredUnitUnit`, `declaredUnitQuantity`, `lcaReferenceLifetime`, `thirdPartyVerification`)
  to provide necessary context for interpreting the environmental indicators.
  
  **Data Reconstruction**: To reconstruct the hierarchical structure:
  1. Group rows by `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` for products
  2. All rows for a product share the same parent context (declared unit, lifetime, verification)
  3. Each row represents a different life cycle stage (A1-A3, B1-B7, C1-C4, D)

      Array of flattened product LCA declarations.
      Each item represents a single life cycle stage declaration for a product.
      
      Rows are ordered by:
      1. `manufacturerIdGln` (ascending)
      2. `manufacturerProductNumber` (ascending)
      3. `lifeCycleStage` (ascending)

      Cursor-based pagination metadata.
      
      The cursor encodes the position based on the composite key:
      `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` + `lifeCycleStage`

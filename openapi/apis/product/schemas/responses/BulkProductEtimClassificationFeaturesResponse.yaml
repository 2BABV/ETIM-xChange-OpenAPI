  Bulk response containing flattened product ETIM classification features with cursor-based pagination.
  
  **Flattened Structure**: Each row represents a single feature value within a product's ETIM classification.
  This structure is optimized for:
  - Predictable payload sizes (each row has consistent structure)
  - Efficient cursor-based pagination by feature
  - ETL/data warehouse ingestion
  - Streaming data processing
  
  **Payload Optimization**: Optional properties with null values are omitted from the response
  to minimize payload size. Clients should treat missing properties as null/not applicable.
  
  **Data Reconstruction**: To reconstruct the hierarchical structure:
  1. Group rows by `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` for products
  2. Within each product, group by `etimClassCode` + `etimClassVersion` for classifications
  3. Features are individual rows within each classification group
  
  **Classification-Only Rows**: Products with classifications but no features are represented
  with `etimFeatureCode` omitted to ensure all classifications are included.

      Array of flattened product ETIM classification features.
      Each item represents a single feature value for a product classification.
      
      Rows are ordered by:
      1. `manufacturerIdGln` (ascending)
      2. `manufacturerProductNumber` (ascending)
      3. `etimClassCode` (ascending)
      4. `etimFeatureCode` (ascending, nulls first)

      Cursor-based pagination metadata.
      
      The cursor encodes the position based on the composite key:
      `manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber` + `etimClassCode` + `etimFeatureCode`

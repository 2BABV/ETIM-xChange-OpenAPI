  Response containing a single product with all its components.
  
  The product key (`manufacturerIdGln` + `manufacturerProductNumber`) is at the root level,
  with nested objects for each component:
  - `details`: GTINs, brand, dates, customs data, status, warranties
  - `descriptions`: Array of multilingual descriptions (nested, not flattened)
  - `etimClassifications`: Array of ETIM classifications with embedded features (nested)
  - `lcaEnvironmental`: Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) data
  
  This structure aligns with the subresource endpoints (`/details`, 
  `/descriptions`, `/etim-classifications`, `/lca-environmental`) which all include the key at the root level.

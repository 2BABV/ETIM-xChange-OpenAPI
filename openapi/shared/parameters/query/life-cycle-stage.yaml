  Filter LCA declarations by life cycle stage(s) according to EN 15804.
  Multiple stages can be specified to return declarations for those stages only.
  If not specified, all stages are returned.
  
  Product stage (A):
  - `A1`: Raw material supply
  - `A2`: Transport to manufacturer
  - `A3`: Manufacturing
  - `A1-A3`: Combined product stage
  - `A4`: Transport to building site
  - `A5`: Installation into building
  
  Use stage (B):
  - `B1`: Use/Application
  - `B2`: Maintenance
  - `B3`: Repair
  - `B4`: Replacement
  - `B5`: Refurbishment
  - `B6`: Operational energy use
  - `B7`: Operational water use
  - `B1-B7`: Combined use stage
  
  End of life stage (C):
  - `C1`: Deconstruction/demolition
  - `C2`: Transport to waste processing
  - `C3`: Waste processing
  - `C4`: Disposal
  - `C1-C4`: Combined end of life stage
  
  Beyond life cycle (D):
  - `D`: Reuse, recovery, recycling potential
